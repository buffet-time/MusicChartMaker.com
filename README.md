# Music Charting Website

## This website was initially developed to replace Topsters because

1. The owner of Topsters 2 is incredibly problematic.
2. Topsters 2 is clunky, unoptimized, and sloppy.
3. [Patrician Music Chartposting](https://www.facebook.com/groups/patricianmusicchartposting) commenters wanted it
4. Topsters 2 isn't open source.

## This website is now developed because

1. Same reasons as above
2. Other Alternatives are slower, larger bundles, have less features
3. Topsters 3 isn't open source
