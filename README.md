# Music Charting Website

## This website was developed to replace Topsters because

1. The owner of Topsters is incredibly problematic.
2. Topsters is clunky, unoptimized, and sloppy.
3. [Patrician Music Chartposting](https://www.facebook.com/groups/patricianmusicchartposting) commenters wanted it
4. Topsters isn't open source.
